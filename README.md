# 🍽️ SmartMess – A Feedback System for Hostel Messes

## 💡 Problem

As a hostel student, I often found myself frustrated with inconsistent mess food quality.  
And I wasn't alone — friends across hostels had similar complaints.  
But the bigger issue?  
➡️ **There was no structured, data-backed feedback system.**  
Students had opinions. Mess admins lacked insights. Everyone was disconnected.

## 🧠 My Insight

> **"What if I could build a simple feedback loop between students and mess management?"**

That's how **SmartMess** was born — a lightweight, intuitive system to collect, analyze, and act on student feedback in real-time.
