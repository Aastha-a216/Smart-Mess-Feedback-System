# SmartMess Feedback Dashboard

SmartMess is a lightweight web-based feedback system designed to improve food quality in college messes through real-time student feedback and data-driven insights. Built with a product management mindset, it addresses a common pain point faced by students in Tier 2/3 campuses: lack of structured feedback channels for meal quality.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

College mess food is a universal pain point—often students are dissatisfied, but feedback is either informal, ignored, or inaccessible to decision-makers. This lack of a structured system leads to:
- Repeated poor-quality meals
- No visibility into student preferences
- No data for mess committees to act upon

---

## 🎯 Solution Overview

SmartMess is a digital feedback loop that:
- Captures daily ratings (1–5 stars) and comments from students
- Visualizes trends using interactive charts
- Stores feedback locally or can be extended to backend APIs
- Is accessible, responsive, and anonymous

---

## 🧑‍💻 Features

- ⭐ Star rating system (1–5)
- 📝 Optional anonymous comment submission
- 📊 Feedback analytics chart (powered by Chart.js)
- 💾 Persistent storage using LocalStorage
- 🌐 Built with HTML, CSS (no frameworks), and Vanilla JS
